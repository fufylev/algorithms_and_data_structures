### Records of all algorithms I've written throughout the *MicroMasters® Program in Algorithms and Data Structures* 
#### *[This program](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures)* is provided by University of California San Diego via *[edX](https://www.edx.org).*

All algorithms are being written in Python 3 as I am most familiar with Python among other languages proposed by *University of California San Diego*.

All functions which names ends with the word ***"_naive"*** are given by course materials as a starter algorithm for the problem's solution - usually works but **too slow**

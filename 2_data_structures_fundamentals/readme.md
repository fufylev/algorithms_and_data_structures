### Welcome!

#### Welcome to Data Structures Fundamentals!

In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.

### Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of at least one programming language (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python2, Python3, Scala): loops, arrays, stacks, recursion. Basic knowledge of mathematics: proof by induction, proof by contradiction.

#### Course Overview
Programming Assignments are a very important part of this course. We believe that the only way to understand a data structure is to implement it. If you're studying this course as a part of Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program, you're already familiar with the style of the programming assignments from the first course of the program â€” Algorithmic Design and Techniques. However, if you're taking this class independently, we strongly recommend that before you start working on the Programming Assignments in this course, you first go through the videos and readings of the first week of the Algorithmic Design and Techniques course: they will guide you through the process of implementing a solution, testing it, finding bugs, fixing them and submitting the assignment.

### A few examples of questions that we are going to cover in this class are the following:
What is a good strategy of resizing a dynamic array?
How priority queues are implemented in C++, Java, and Python?
How to implement a hash table so that the amortized running time of all operations is O(1) on average?
What are good strategies to keep a binary tree balanced?

You will also learn what is Block Chain, how does it work, why does it work that way, and what tool does this technology provide in essense.
We look forward to seeing you in this class! We know it will make you a better programmer.

#### Learning Objectives
You will learn the fundamental data structures, how do they work, and how to apply them to make your programs run several orders of magnitude faster. In the process, you will implement many of these data structures and apply them in appropriate problems while solving 14 Programming Challenges ranging from basic level to advanced.
